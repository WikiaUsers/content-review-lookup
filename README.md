# content-review-lookup
This repository contains a dump of all sitewide JavaScript on Fandom and scripts used to generate that dump. It was made for easier code analysis and search.

The `dist/` directory contains subfolders for each wiki's sitewide JavaScript pages. Contents of pages are licensed under CC-BY-SA and can be mapped to actual pages on Fandom.

## Setup
To install required dependencies, run:
```console
$ npm install
```
To run the script that generates the `dist/` directory, run:
```
$ npm run
```
