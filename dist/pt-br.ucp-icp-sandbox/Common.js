/**
 * This is a sandbox wiki with the sole purpose of testing the port to Fandom's UCP of
 * a Star Wars Wiki em Português' script called ICP. As such, it is expected that this script
 * will be changing quite a bit, as I make sure that everything it does now will continue
 * to work once Star Wars Wiki is moved to UCP. Therefore, since the whole point of this wiki
 * is to test this particular script, it would be best if I could deploy new changes to it very
 * quickly, so that the editors that help me test it can see the changes almost as soon as I
 * publish them. Again, this wiki is not to be used for anything other than testing this script
 * (hence Ucp icp sandox), so I don't think that would be an issue in this particular case.
 * Of course, this will not be done on Star Wars Wiki em Português.
 * 
 * Btw, because the script is quite large, it is divided into two files.
 * Original script: https://starwars.fandom.com/pt/wiki/MediaWiki%3AICP.js
 * Original script: https://starwars.fandom.com/pt/wiki/MediaWiki%3ASWWICP.js
