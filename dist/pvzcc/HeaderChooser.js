/*
	How this works:
	1. A text list is chosen randomly from possibleTexts. Each list's probability is based on its weight.
	2. A single text is then chosen randomly from that chosen list. The chance is equally likely among the list.
	3. That one chosen text is displayed as the header community name.
	
	Note: weights of the lists don't need to add up to 100. They're all relative.
